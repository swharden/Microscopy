## Setup
Edit your `StartupMacros.txt` file (which lives in Program Files / Micro Manager / macros) and add a line so `SWHLab.ijm` is executed at startup. It is ideal to have it executed after the micro-manager studio runs (which connects to the camera).

```javascript
macro "AutoRun" {
  run("Micro-Manager Studio");
  run("Install...", "install=[C:\\path\\to\\SWHLab.ijm]");
}
```

## Demo: timestamping (and drug-stamping) TIFs
I saved micrographs as a TIF then converted them to a BMP image sequence and used AVIDemux to make it an MP4 suitable for YouTube
